Project Description: Website for a New Religion

This project involves the creation of a modern, visually impactful, and spiritually grounded website for a newly founded religion.

The website will serve as the official platform for followers and newcomers, offering access to sacred texts, teachings, rituals, events, and tools for personal spiritual development. It will also provide opportunities for engagement, such as discussion forums, membership registration, and multimedia resources.
